# vexgraph's vexspoke — C23 Engine & Multi-Repo Preferences

;;EDITION("2026.09-universal")

The engine is a relational system where **everything is a pointer**.
These laws are hard requirements, not suggestions. This document is the
**Universal Supreme Constitution** governing all repositories across the vexgraph ecosystem.
Repo-specific laws and subsystem slices are codified in repo-local `<repo>-preferences.md` files
per the *Per-Repo Preferences Extension Law*.

## The Law Identity Doctrine (Title Over Number)

> [!WARNING]
> **A law is its Title, never its number.** Every law in this document
> carries exactly one canonical Title — *No Arrow Sugar Law*, *Dest-Last Law*,
> *Teardown Order Law*. The integer that prefixes a section is a **positional
> ordinal**: it keeps the document in a readable order and nothing more. It is
> not the law's identity, it never participates in a citation, and it may
> change at any moment as laws are inserted, promoted, split, or merged.
>
> This is a living document (the *Living Preferences Law*). Numbers drift
> under that life — laws grow, split, and renumber — so a citation pinned to a
> number silently goes stale and starts pointing at the wrong law. A citation
> pinned to a Title is immune to renumbering. **Never quote a number when you
> mean a law.** Everywhere a law is referenced — code annotations
> (`;;INTENTION("per the No Arrow Sugar Law")`), `;;OVERVIEW` headers,
> README/CONTRIBUTING taxonomies, `_docs/*`, commit messages — cite the Title,
> in this exact form:
>
> ```c
> ;;INTENTION("per the Single Class Per File Law + the Living ;;OVERVIEW Blueprint Law")
> ```
>
> **Sub-numbering is abolished.** There are no `11.4` or `35.3` laws.
> Anything that once carried a fractional number is now a whole law with its
> own Title and its own ordinal. The literal `n.n` notation is a defect on
> arrival and must never be re-introduced.

## Separation of Concerns: Rule Taxonomy

To ensure uncompromising architectural consistency across all repositories and contributors (human and AI), the universal laws are partitioned into three distinct tiers of concern, each defined with its architectural **Definition** and foundational **Why**:

1. **Tier 1: Critical Architectural Invariants & Memory Consistency (Non-Negotiable Core)**
   - *Concern*: Hardware execution safety, zero steady-state allocation, lifetime predictability, thread safety, and crash prevention.
   - *Laws*: the Single Class Per File Law, the Cohesive Commits Law & the Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law, the Build & Naming Conventions Law (Apple Silicon native), the Teardown Order Law, the Bounded Wait Law, the Four System Levels Law (L1–L4, distinct from R1–R5 Supervisor Order), the Cold-Strict hot-minimal contract half (never crash/block/allocate/use-after-free), the Test Segregation Law, the Dynamic Scalability & Anti-Hardcoding Law.
   - *The Why*: Violations cause segmentation faults, thread deadlocks, memory leaks, GPU driver crashes, un-bisectable repositories, or codebase pollution.

2. **Tier 2: Semantics, Object Models & Living Contracts**
   - *Concern*: Relational memory layout, object-oriented encapsulation in pure C23, deterministic constructor dispatch, symmetric introspection, and self-documenting code contracts.
   - *Laws*: the Dest-Last Law, the Two-Layer Access Cap Law, the Living `;;OVERVIEW` & `;;DEFINITION` Blueprint Law (constructor dispatch macros), the Vertical Integration Law (Supervisor Order R1–R5), the One Type Registry Law, the Canonical Include Paths Law & the Standalone Autonomy Law, the Identity & Naming Transition Law, the Symmetric Getter/Setter Completeness Law, the Arity and Constructive Convenience Law, the toString Law, the Authorial Intent Law, the AI-First Architecture Manifesto Law, the Living Preferences Law, the Conflict Triage Law, the Cold-Strict hot-minimal contract half (setter validation policy, truncation flag, seam tests), the Data-Oriented Storage Law, the Living Feature Readiness Law, the Per-Repo Preferences Extension Law.
   - *The Why*: High-level C code must act as a reliable, predictable class system. Every struct field must have transparent, symmetric access; every class must be fully documented in-place.

3. **Tier 3: Syntactic Aesthetics & Mechanical Determinism**
   - *Concern*: Eliminating ambiguous syntax, visual sugar, and aliasing that obscures pointer operations or impairs machine readability.
   - *Laws*: the No Arrow Sugar Law, the Cast Spacing Law, the Function Naming Law, the Single-Line If Law, the No Auto-Pushing Law, the Two-Semicolon Annotation Style Law, the Commit and Push Discipline Law, the Pointer Declaration Spacing Law, the Per-Repo Commit Message Scope Law, the No Section Sign Law.
   - *The Why*: The codebase is engineered for AI-human pair systems programming. Machine reasoning thrives on explicit, un-sugared syntax where every dereference is visible and unambiguous.

## 1. No Arrow Sugar Law

Never use `->`. Field access is always `(*ptr).field`.

```c
(*this).x = 5;            // yes
this->x = 5;              // no
```

---

## 2. Cast Spacing Law

A cast has exactly one space to the right of `)`.

```c
uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t) ptr;      // yes
uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t)ptr;       // no
```

---

## 3. Single Class Per File Law (Java Law)

A class is `typedef struct Class {} Class;` — same name for tag and typedef.

```c
typedef struct SpinLock { ... } SpinLock;   // yes
typedef struct _spin_lock { ... } SpinLock; // no
```

One public class struct per `.h`/`.c` pair, period. File name is the
lowercase class name (`spin.h`/`spin.c`, `hot_module.h`/`hot_module.c`).
A second public `typedef struct` in the same file is a defect, no matter
how small — split it into its own file pair. One problem in one file
stays in one file and never risks the whole architecture.

Private file-local helpers (`static` structs with no behavior, or pure-data
sub-records with no `Class_*` functions) are the sole exception: they stay
in the owning `.c` and must never be included by another file. If kept, the
overview MUST list each helper with its full field list (type, name, and
one-line role) under `PRIVATE HELPERS` — same field detail as the main
class, so the file's whole memory layout reads from the header alone.
Anything with behavior
(`trampoline_register/get/set`, `hot_retire_handle`, `find_module`, ...)
is a class and gets its own file.

Slot records are the one co-location allowed: a behaviorless row/entry
struct owned by exactly one class (its table/ring/pool) may live in that
class's file pair, documented as `SLOT RECORD` in the overview. It must
have zero `Class_*` functions of its own — all behavior hangs off the
owning class (`HotTrampoline` row vs `HotTrampolineTable`,
`HotRetiredHandle` vs `HotRetireRing`). Two classes with behavior never
share a file; one class plus its dumb slots may.

The overview's `STRUCT FIELDS` section always mirrors exactly the file's
own class — the struct matching the file name — field-for-field, in
declaration order. No foreign class fields there; kept helpers live only
under `PRIVATE HELPERS` with their own fields.

---

## 4. Function Naming Law

- The symbol name in the source is lowercase camelCase (`functionName`).
- It is called as `Class_functionName(params)`.

```c
static uint32_t ticket(uint64_t thread_id) { ... }   // definition

uint32_t t = SpinLock_ticket(0);                    // call site
```

---

## 5. Single-Line If Law

An `if` with one statement uses no braces — a bare one-liner on the next line.

```c
if(foo)
    (*coo).doo(params);
```

Multi-statement bodies always use braces.

---

## 6. Cohesive Commits Law

Commits must be strictly cohesive and buildable: **one logical feature or subsystem unit per repository**. Because the ecosystem consists of multiple specialized repositories that are assessed independently, git histories must be clean, traceable, and fully bisectable.
- **Per Repository**: Commits must be executed locally inside the specific repository's git root (`../<repo>`). Never cross repository boundaries in a single commit, and never bundle multiple repos into one untracked commit.
- **Atomic & Bisectable**: Every commit MUST compile cleanly (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`) and include its build wiring (`CMakeLists.txt`). Broken intermediate states or dead unwired commits are defects that ruin `git bisect`.
- **Cohesive Scope**:
  - Independent classes or isolated fixes commit individually: `feat(cursor): ...`, `fix(label): ...`.
  - Tightly coupled class pairs or cohesive subsystems landing together (e.g. `mesh` + `meshlet`, `brush` + `raster_brush`, `fence` + `semaphore` + `command_buffer`) commit together as a unified functional unit: `feat(mesh): ...`, `feat(paint): ...`, `feat(sync): ...`.
  - Never bundle multiple unrelated subsystems into a single untracked omnibus blob.
- Cross-cutting dependencies commit **upstream-first** per the Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law (`vexspoke` -> `graphvex`/`api-haven`/`language`/`darkbase` -> `hotcwap` -> `darling-framework`/`sesh` -> `vexgraph`).
Per-file means per-class file pair: one commit lands the owning `.h` plus its `.c` plus build wiring plus its `;;OVERVIEW` update together and must compile `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. A literal single-file behavior commit that leaves its pair unbuildable is a defect. Exception (L1-only, the Conflict Triage Law): comment/docs/manifest-only single-file commits with zero struct/API change that compile cleanly are permitted with class scope. Stack large pairs instead of splitting them.

---

## 7. No Auto-Pushing Law

Never run `git push` on your own. When I explicitly tell you to "push", treat it as a one-off command: execute a single `git push` to sync the repository, and then immediately revert to your default state of never auto-pushing. Regardless of pushing, you must always continue making local, granular commits for every completed feature.

---

## 8. Two-Semicolon Annotation Style Law

Annotations (`src/annotation/*.h`) are written with two semicolons on the left
side only, so they read as explicit markers:

```c
;;OVERVIEW
;;DEFINITION
;;GETTER
;;SETTER
;;DRAFT
;;INCOMPLETE
;;PLATFORM_EXCLUSIVE("Windows")
;;INTENTION("reason")
;;SYNC("provenance")
```

Two semicolons on the left, nothing on the right — even when the annotation
carries params. The semicolons are plain null declarations; the marker macro
inside expands to a `_Static_assert` that validates the annotation text.

---

## 9. Dest-Last Law

Output parameters come LAST: `(a, b, dest)` / `(left, right, dest)`. Reads
left-to-right like math; the result lands where it belongs, at the end.

```c
Vec4_add(a, b, dest);        // yes
Mat4_multiply(left, right, dest); // yes
Vec4_add(dest, a, b);        // no
```

---

## 10. Two-Layer Access Cap Law

A member/index chain touches at most TWO layers deep:

```c
(*layer1).layer2             // yes — the deepest a chain goes
(*p).items[i]                // yes — indexing rides on its base hop
(*(*ptr).field).field2       // no — three layers
obj.field.field2.field3      // no — three layers
```

Anything deeper must hoist an intermediate into a local first
(`Field *f = &(*layout).items[i];` then `(*f).offset`).

### The Rationale (Java Object References & Eliminating Pointer Chasing):
In Java, an object reference (`Car car = new Car();`) is never an inline struct; it is purely a pointer under the hood. Instead of hiding behind syntactical illusions or garbage collection, `vexspoke` **embraces the pointer directly**.
When high-level languages allow arbitrary dot-chaining (`car.engine.turbo.valve.pressure`), software falls into the trap of **pointer chasing**—drifting from address to pointer to pointer across disparate memory pages, thrashing CPU cache lines and obscuring memory latency.
Physical hardware memory access is fundamentally simple: **one level + offset**. That is precisely what `(*ptr).field` is: `base_address + field_offset`.
By capping access to at most two layers, pointer hops remain explicit, measurable, and bounded. Accessing a deeper child requires hoisting it into a local variable (`Engine *e = (*car).engine;`), making every memory hop deliberate, visible in machine registers, and impossible to overlook. That's how simple it is.

---

## 11. Build & Naming Conventions Law

- `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, `-mcpu=native` (host apple-mN; portable across Apple Silicon — baseline `apple-m1`/`generic` if strict M1 compat needed), C23 (gnu23).
- Files are lowercase (`variable.c`, `spin.h`); classes are CapitalCase.
- Structs act as classes: state lives on the struct, behavior lives in
  `Class_functionName(struct Class *self, ...)`.

---

---

## 12. Commit and Push Discipline Law

- **Never push unless explicitly asked.** A push request is a one-time button press; do not auto-push subsequent changes.
- **Always commit locally.** Continue implementing granular, per-class local commits regardless of whether a push was requested.
- Do not commit unless the change actually fixes or finishes something — broken
  intermediate states stay dirty on disk.
- Commits are per logical fix/feature per class. Keep classes and features isolated.

---

## 13. Pointer Declaration Spacing Law

Pointer declarators are always `T *name` — one space before `*`, `*` binds to the name, no space after `*`.

```c
Buffer *buf;                          // yes
struct IOSurfaceChild *child;         // yes
void *data;                           // yes
void *Memory_alloc(uint32_t t, size_t n); // yes — return type follows same rule

Buffer* buf;                          // no — star touches type
Buffer * buf;                         // no — space after star
void* data;                           // no
struct IOSurfaceChild* child;         // no
```

Casts are the sole exception: `(T*) var` — no space before `*` inside the cast, then one space after `)` per the Cast Spacing Law:

```c
(void*) ptr;                          // yes
(Block*) (aligned - HEADER_SIZE);     // yes
(SpinLock*) lock;                     // yes
(int64_t*) addr;                      // yes — same for deref casts: *(int64_t*) addr

(void *) ptr;                         // no — space before * inside cast
(void*)ptr;                           // no — missing space after )
(Block *) ptr;                        // no
```

Declarators vs casts: `T *name` in declarations, `(T*) var` in casts — star binds to name in decls, to type inside cast parens. Multi-pointer or function-pointer follows decl spacing: `char **argv` is `char **argv` (space before first `*`), `void (*fn)(void *arg)` etc. When in doubt, `*` stays with name in decls, with type inside `( )` casts.

## 14. Vertical Integration Law — Single Order To Follow (R1 > R2 > R3 > R4 > R5)

The stack has ONE order. Lower R = boots earlier, more stable, tears down later. Follow this everywhere.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ R1 — HOST (hotcwap)                                                    │
│ Supervisor; Kernel = registries + dispatch. NO Kernel tick, NO pump      │

```

How to read the arrows (the only two directions in the whole repo):
- `supervises ▼` (runtime): R1 boots R2, loads R3 dylibs, registers R4 UI, R5 apps. Teardown runs reverse per the Teardown Order Law.
- `borrows shape ▲` (compile-time): a file may only `#include` shapes from the allowlist below. Supervisor borrows leaf shapes; leaf never borrows supervisor shapes.
- `registers ◀` (engines): R5 never gets `#include`d by R1. R1 holds `void*`
  + per-kind fn-tables (`ProcessEntry`, `AppRunFn`/`AppTickFn`/`AppHotReloadFn`,
  `ConsoleIo`) + `HotModule`. Same feature, no circular link, standalone
  stays green per the Standalone Autonomy Law. Windowed Applications
  additionally register a frame-handler frame-client into graphvex's
  `GfxLoop` — opaque handle + callback, never an `#include`.

Allowlist (only includes permitted — everything else is a defect):
- R2 `vexspoke`: includes NOTHING from `graphvex`/`hotcwap`/`darling`/`api-haven`/engines. Pure leaf.
- R3 `graphvex`: includes `vexspoke` only. Never `hotcwap`/`darling`/`api-haven`/engines.
- R3 `api-haven`: `vexspoke` only, no graphics; may define pure connector contracts — descriptor registries plus fn-pointer client shapes (e.g. `AiProvider`, `DbProvider`, `McpServer` — `AppDetect`/`CaptureTool`/`ProcessProbe` live in vexspoke R2 and are consumed, never re-implemented) — with zero vendor/database includes; contract class names never collide with owner interfaces (the `Database` interface stays with darkbase). MCP tool/resource surfaces (stdio JSON-RPC engines and their `mcp_server` runners) are connector-shape hosting and live in api-haven; they host handler closures over those registries/probes only — no exec, no writes, no vendor SDKs.
- R3 `language`/`darkbase`: `vexspoke` (+ `graphvex` for GPU-backed ones) only, never engines.
- R1 `hotcwap`: includes `vexspoke` (arena/event/input/time) + `graphvex` (buffer/GPU) only. Never `darling`/`api-haven`/database/language/engine headers.
- R4 `darling-framework`: includes `vexspoke` + `graphvex` + `hotcwap` (`window/window.h`) only. Never `api-haven`/engines.
- R4 `sesh`: `vexspoke` + `api-haven` (WsFanout) only. Never graphics engines.
- R5 engines (`semicolon`, `samplerate`, `darling-editor`, `drawling`, `anti`): borrow shapes from R1/R2/R3/R4 to build; own no OS/window/memory management — borrow arenas, windows, GPU instances from R1. Standalone-capable or Kernel-registered.

Managed exceptions — socket/spawn/decode seams (waivers under the Conflict Triage Law, Tier 1 preserved):
- R2 `vexspoke` owns the `WsClient` + `ProcessSpawn` leaf drivers. `WsClient`
  is a bounded frame slot (fixed rx buffer, state, cancel flag, timeoutNs):
  no threads, no owned sockets — the R1 driver owns the socket and feeds
  bytes in; `WsClient_poll` waits at most 100ms in ~1ms cancel-checked
  slices (the Bounded Wait Law, drop-degrade false). `ProcessSpawn` is a
  bounded child-job table (fixed slots, cancel flag): `posix_spawnp` launch
  (never `system()`), non-blocking `waitpid` reap slices bounded to 100ms,
  `SIGTERM` cancel — no blocking wait, no `UINT64_MAX`, zero threads.
- R3 `graphvex` owns `FrameImporter` (pure RGBA8→`Image` upload via
  `Image_upload`): no `popen`, no `libav*` include/link, no threads; callers
  decode through the `ProcessSpawn` shape and never call it from
  tick/render paths.
- R3 `api-haven` owns `HavenWsFanout` (16-slot fan-out registry over opaque
  `void*` handles + `WsSource` fn-table `{connect, poll, send, close}`,
  `pollStep` budget-driven by R1) + `AiSse` (pure caller-fed incremental
  SSE `data:`/`event:` state machine bound explicitly to one fanout slot
  via the existing `WsSource` table, R1-budgeted `pollStep`, 100ms slices,
  drop-degrade false, zero socket/thread/alloc, truncation flag per the
  Cold-Strict, Hot-Minimal Validation Law) + `DbProvider` catalog-only
  read-only SQLite file row (`DbSqliteFile`: path, caps, bounds, fn-table
  only, zero `sqlite3.h` include/link — execution delegates via opaque handle
  to the database owner / vexspoke File/VFS) + `AssetBroker`
  (`AssetBroker_downloadToCache` bounded chunked-copy
  `(srcChunk, dest, destCap, outTruncated)` dest-last, per-chunk 100ms
  budget + cancel flag, never a whole-file budget, `VexHome_cache`-confined,
  closed before `Memory_freeAll`): zero `pthread_*`, zero socket syscalls,
  no scraping, no exec, no vendor SDK; transports stay in R2, driven by
  R1 callbacks only.

Build/commit order (dependencies first, per the Multi-Repo Atomic Commit
Discipline Law): `vexspoke` -> `graphvex`/`api-haven`/`language`/`darkbase` ->
`hotcwap` -> `darling-framework`/`sesh` -> `semicolon`/`samplerate`/
`darling-editor`/`drawling`/`anti`. Boot order is the reverse crown: R1
first.

1. **R2 `vexspoke` Behavior**:
   - Owns: `Variable`, `BitPool`, `Memory`/`MemoryArena`, `RingBuffer`/`SpinLock`, `Type`/`Class`, math, `http`/`json`, `VexHome`/`File`/`Log`, audio, base Vulkan context, **system capability probes (`AppDetect`, `CaptureTool`, `ProcessProbe`)**.
   - `Reactive` (the per-variable event emitter) carries an **atomic** payload + dirty flag, so `Reactive_set` is safe from ANY thread; notification is **owner-affine** — `Reactive_set` never fires observers, the owner (Thread 0 pump/paint) calls `Reactive_drain`, which coalesces the pending writes into one `onSet`/`onChanged` batch on the owner's thread. This keeps the atomicity in the value (no lock, no unbounded wait — the Bounded Wait Law) while keeping every observer on the owner's thread (the Present-On-Demand Law applied to data); the observer lists themselves stay owner-affine.

2. **R3 Drivers — graphvex | api-haven | language | darkbase**:
   - `graphvex`: `spv/` blobs, `Buffer` family, `Font`/`FontBake`, `SdfGpu`, `Texture`, `Raster`, `WgpuBackend`.
   - `api-haven`: API surface, telemetry, webhooks + connector contracts (AI providers, app detection, database catalog/connector shapes) + the MCP tool/resource server (`McpServer`, `mcp_server` stdio runner) hosting them.
   - `language`: `Language` contract (`Lang_tokenize/parse/highlight/...`), each grammar a hot-swappable dylib.
   - `darkbase`: `Database` interface, native vex store in-budget.

3. **R1 `hotcwap` Host**:
   - Owns: `Kernel` (`../hotcwap/kernel/kernel.h`), the **three process
     kinds** in `hotcwap/process/` (`process/process.{c,h}`,
     `process/application.{c,h}`, `process/console.{c,h}`), `Window`,
     `Hot`/`Manifest`/`VkLoader`/`SpvWatch`.
   - **Process taxonomy (classify by the first matching question):**
     1. Presents pixels through a Window/board composite chain
        (`CAMetalLayer` + swapchain)? → **Application** — a pure *manifest*:
        identity (name/author/version/icon), window registry,
        and a hot-module slot. It NEVER owns a tick, a present worker, a
        frame scheduler, or an event router — `Application_start/stop` flip
        the `running` flag, and `Application_run` is the keep-alive parked
        loop (hotcwap's own, graphvex-independent): it BLOCKS until every
        registered window is closed, letting the Window pump its own events
        in 25ms slices and asking closed-state at a 250ms cadence — so an
        empty window lives on its own and `Kernel_run(kernel, app)` returns
        only once the user closed all windows. The Kernel (R1) dispatches the
        Application into graphvex's `GfxLoop` (R3),
        which drives the Thread-0 event pump, frame scheduling, presentation
        (demand-driven, the Present-On-Demand Law + the Continuous Real-Time
        Live Resize Law), and telemetry writes through the Window's C
        callback bridge. window attach/detach lifecycle, present-on-demand.
     2. Talks to a tty/stdio, executes shell scripts, or hosts a REPL/session?
        → **Console** — never a window; borrows R2 `ProcessSpawn`/`File`/
        `VexHome` for execution. A session pump state machine (`ConsoleIo`
        fn-table seam per the Conflict Triage Law), polled in bounded 100ms
        slices with a cancel flag (the Bounded Wait Law) by a supervised
        thread — zero sockets, zero threads owned.
     3. Neither — just a function? → **Process** — one-shot invocable wrapping
        one `int (*ProcessEntry)(void *context)` on the caller's thread.
        Re-runnable, never ticked; one invocation at a time. `Process_run`
        returns admission status separately from the callback's exit status.
        `Process_replace` changes entry/context/hot association together between
        calls, returning busy rather than waiting. Name and context are borrowed;
        freeing requires deregistration and external exclusion of API callers.
        A hot association is not a pin: callers must keep code loaded during
        execution until generation pinning is integrated with the loader.
   - **One type per process.** Classification is the *primary contract*:
     surface > stdio > function. A terminal-in-a-window is composition — an
     Application hosting a child Console via `ProcessSpawn` — never a hybrid.
   - **Kernel is an object that stores and dispatches work — never an
     executor.** `Kernel` owns the arenas, the three registries
     (`processes`/`applications`/`consoles`, all doubling arena slabs per the
     Dynamic Scalability & Anti-Hardcoding Law), and the supervised `Thread`
     registry. There is **no `Kernel_tick`, no present worker field, and no
     Kernel-owned pump thread**: `Kernel_run` is a thin reference forward that
     hands each registered kind to its own run function — `Process_run()` for
     one-shot invokables, `Console_run()` for session pumps, and graphvex
     `GfxLoop` registration for Applications (which then drives the frame
     loop, the Thread-0 event pump, presentation, and `frame(app, dt)`
     handler invocation on live bounds as a demand-driven frame scheduler,
     the Present-On-Demand Law + the Continuous Real-Time Live Resize Law).
     The Kernel never implements the work itself, so hot-reloading a module
     swaps the running code without touching the supervisor.
   - `Application`/`Process`/`Console` are final infrastructure — R5 apps rely
     on them, they never rely on R5. An Application never grows a loop back:
     tick/render/present/poll are graphvex (frame) and Kernel-dispatch
     (start/stop) jobs, steering through the Window's C callback bridge only.

4. **R4 Interfaces — darling-framework | sesh**:
   - `darling-framework`: `Canvas`/`Container`/`Panel`/widgets/compositor/`panel_bridge.c`.
   - `sesh`: Session sync, VPS relay, Cloudflare edge, in-engine bug ingestion.

5. **R5 Interactables**:
   - `semicolon`: Mini IDE (5MB jGRASP/Zed target, shell-out toolchains, xlsx viewer).
   - `samplerate`: Bare-metal DAW (realtime mixer, spatial audio, 3D HRTF).
   - `darling-editor`: Spatial studio (Figma + Miro board, infinite canvas, HTML/SVG export).
   - `drawling`: Drawing studio (GIMP/Krita/FlipaClip target, layers, brushes).
   - `anti`: 3D game engine (5-column editor, bindless, meshlets, physics, darkbase).
   - N x the three process kinds x M windows per `Kernel` — the registries are
     doubling arena slabs (the Dynamic Scalability & Anti-Hardcoding Law, zero
     ceilings): `processes` (invocables), `applications` (windowed),
     `consoles` (sessions).

6. **`vexgraph` (Top-Level Integrator & Application Root)**:
   - The umbrella project that nests the repositories in `../` and builds unified binaries, probes (`main/vk_test.c`), and tooling.

---

## 15. One Type Registry Law (Project-Scoped Identity, Uniform Per-Project Numbering)

- **Type identity is project-scoped, never class-number-scoped.** A bare class number is meaningless without its project: vexspoke `#3` (`ID_DOUBLE`) and darling `#3` (`ID_CANVAS`) are entirely different types, because their 64-bit ids carry different PROJECT bytes. To identify any id you **must first resolve its project, then switch on the class number within that project's scope**:
  ```c
  switch (Type_arch(id)) {              // project dispatch FIRST
      case ARCH_VEXSPOKE:  ... // then Type_class(id) ranks vexspoke's registry 1..N
      case ARCH_GRAPHVEX:   ... // then Type_class(id) ranks graphvex's registry 1..N
      case ARCH_DARLING:    ... // then Type_class(id) ranks darling's registry 1..N
  }
  ```
  The 64-bit layout `0x F PRPR M W1 W2 PDPD CCCCCCCC` anchors identity on the 8-bit PROJECT byte (`PROJ_VEXSPOKE`, `PROJ_DARLING`, `PROJ_GRAPHVEX`, `PROJ_HOTCWAP`, ...); the 32-bit class field is only an index into that project's registry. `Type_arch` reads the byte out, `Type_class` masks the local number. Every repository owns exactly one class registry in its own `*-type.h` (vexspoke `oop/type.h`, graphvex `graphvex/type.h`, darling `c23/darling-type.h`), numbered **1..N** with gaps allowed — there are **no global hex windows** (id #1 in darling ≠ id #1 in vexspoke).
- **A full id (project bit set) means exact project dispatch. A bare id (project bit zero) means vexspoke's own legacy class space** — `Type_arch(bare)` reports `ARCH_VEXSPOKE` and class numbers resolve through vexspoke's own chain. Cross-project runtime dispatch must therefore pass full ids (`TYPE_*_SINGLETON`) and mask with `Type_class` before comparing against per-class constants; an unmasked comparison against a bare `ID_*` only ever matches vexspoke classes.
- **Single source of truth:** registry macros live only in the repo's `*-type.h`. Widget/class headers define no guarded `ID_X`/`TYPE_X` fallbacks — duplicate definitions are the scattered-registry defect (a pre-state where `richtext_panel.h` and `expandable_list_container.h` both claimed `0x006A`). Views and BEHAVIOR-class registries (`hotcwap` thread ids, etc.) still declare their macros in one centralized winner header per repo.
- **Cross-project parent chains are data, not code:** the child repo grants its chain table once through `Type_registerParents(proj, parents[], count)`, where `parents[i]` is the parent class NUMBER of class # i (`0` = root). Registration is idempotent (re-register replaces), rejects `proj == 0`, non-project-bit, `PROJ_VEXSPOKE`, and `(nullptr, count != 0)`; the slate grows on demand (arena-backed, exponential doubling per the Dynamic Scalability & Anti-Hardcoding Law). An unregistered project byte resolves every class as a root. `Type_isA` keeps the project byte while walking the chain, so `Type_isA(child, bareTarget)` interprets the target as a class number in the child's project.
- Repos with zero registry classes (hotcwap, api-haven today) register nothing; renumbering a repo's `*-type.h` is its own owner-side feature commit (the Cohesive Commits Law / Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law), and downstream consumers of changed class numbers are updated upstream-first (`vexspoke` → `graphvex`/`api-haven`/`hotcwap`/`darling-framework`).

---

## 16. Canonical Include Paths Law (Zero Parent Hops)

Headers must **never** traverse upwards with `../` or `../../` to cross module or repository boundaries. Every `#include` must be rooted at the canonical subsystem directory.

```c
#include "nio/mem.h"               // yes
#include "../nio/mem.h"            // no — legacy monorepo artifact

#include "vulkan/vk.h"             // yes
#include "../vulkan/vk.h"          // no

#include "darling/panel.h"         // yes
#include "font/font.h"             // yes
#include "../font/font.h"          // no

#include "window/window.h"         // yes
#include "hot/hot.h"               // yes
#include "io/vfs.h"                // yes
#include "../../io/vfs.h"          // no
```

This ensures that every source file compiles identically whether it is built inside the unified `vexgraph` tree or as a standalone repository via `FetchContent`.

---

## 17. Standalone Autonomy Law (Target Seam)

Every repository (`vexspoke`, `graphvex`, `hotcwap`, `darling`, `api-haven`) must remain buildable both **standalone** and **in-tree** inside `vexgraph`.

Downstream repositories must guard their upstream dependencies with the `if(NOT TARGET ...)` target seam:

```cmake
# Example in darling/CMakeLists.txt or hotcwap/CMakeLists.txt:
if(NOT TARGET vexspoke)
    # Standalone build: pull upstream via FetchContent
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(
        vexspoke
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/vexgraph-dev/vexspoke.git
        GIT_TAG spoke
    )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(vexspoke)
endif()
```

When building inside `vexgraph`, `vexspoke` already exists as an in-tree target. The guard prevents duplicate target definitions and avoids redundant network fetches.

---

## 18. Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law (Per Feature, Per Subsystem, Per Repo)

The Cohesive Commits Law and the No Auto-Pushing Law apply across all repositories:
- **Per-Repository Execution**: When a change touches a class or feature within a repo, commit locally inside that repository's git root (`../<repo>`). Never commit from the umbrella root for sub-repository changes.
- **Atomic Subsystem Isolation**: Keep commits focused to a single class or cohesive subsystem unit (e.g., `feat(cursor): ...`, `feat(text_core): ...`, or `feat(sync): ...`). Classes that operate as a cohesive pipeline land together with their build wiring; unrelated subsystems must never be bundled into a shared omnibus blob.
- **Upstream First**: Cross-cutting changes spanning multiple repositories must commit in strict downward-only dependency order:
  `vexspoke` -> `graphvex`/`api-haven`/`language`/`darkbase` -> `hotcwap` -> `darling-framework`/`sesh` -> R5 apps.

The old order (`vexspoke` -> `graphvex` -> `hotcwap` -> `darling` -> `api-haven` -> `vexgraph`) is retired; `darling` is now a symlink to `darling-framework`.
- **Zero Giant Blobs**: Assessors evaluate each repository's commit history independently. Grouping unrelated subsystems or multiple repos destroys reviewability.
- **Never Auto-Push**: the No Auto-Pushing Law remains absolute. Commit locally, never push unless explicitly requested.
Upstream-first ordering applies to file-pair commits; each repo-local commit is one file pair per above.

---

## 19. Identity & Naming Transition Law (Anti → Vexspoke / VexHome)

The codebase is actively transitioning from the initial `anti` prototype name to the permanent **`vex`** family identity:
- Engine core: `anti` → `vexspoke` (the central spoke of the graph).
- Engine home directory: `AntiHome` → `VexHome`. Canonical per-platform root (created by `VexHome_ensure()`; `VexHome_cache(subsystem)` builds `<root>/cache/<subsystem>/` with `dictionary.ini` via `VexHome_cacheEnsure`): macOS `~/Library/Application Support/vexgraph`; Linux `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vexgraph` (≈ `~/.local/share/vexgraph`); Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vexgraph`; fallback `$HOME/vex` when the canonical base is unavailable. `$VEX_HOME`, when set and non-empty, overrides all of the above (test seam). Never delete or migrate legacy `~/anti` or `~/vex` automatically.
- Preprocessor definitions: prefer `VEX_*` alongside backwards-compatible `ANTI_*` defines (e.g., `ANTI_SPV_DIR` / `VEX_SPV_DIR`).
- Executable names: `vexspoke_demo` (formerly `anti`) is the headless demo harness inside `vexspoke`, while `vk_test` and full applications live in `vexgraph`.

---

## 20. Living `;;OVERVIEW` & `;;DEFINITION` Blueprint Law

`;;OVERVIEW` and `;;DEFINITION` are the documentation and structural blueprint standards. Every `.c` (and `.m` where applicable) must be self-contained so that a developer or AI agent can immediately understand the class, its memory layout, and all its capabilities from the first 100–150 lines of the implementation file without having to tab back and forth to the `.h` file.

### Separation of Roles:
1. **`;;DEFINITION` — The Architectural Raison d'Être**:
   Precedes or accompanies the overview. Written in fluid, paragraphical prose rather than rigid bureaucratic forms. Its depth scales naturally with the actual complexity of the system:
   - For straightforward data structures or leaf adapters, a focused paragraph explaining its purpose, lifetime, and bounds.
   - For complex coordinators or supervisors, comprehensive paragraphs explaining architectural necessity, memory layout, operational mechanics, concurrency models, and relationship to adjacent subsystems (R1–R5).
2. **`;;OVERVIEW` — The Structural Summary & Public/Private Registry**:
   Serves as the machine-readable and human-scannable diagram of fields, helpers, and functions.

### Public vs. Private Function Registry Standard:
To eliminate the need to inspect the `.h` file just to know what API is externally visible, the function registry is **strictly partitioned into Public (.h) vs. Private (.c static)** sections:
- **Public**: Declared in the owning `.h` header file; exported to library consumers.
- **Private**: Declared `static` within the owning `.c` implementation file; internal file-local helpers.

Both Public and Private categories are subdivided into:
1. **`Constructors`**: Arity-overloaded instance initializers (`Class_0()`, `Class_1()`) called via `Class(...)` macros.
2. **`Core Functions`**: Operational algorithms, coordinate transforms, layout, and rendering logic.
3. **`Setters`**: Mutators (`Class_set*(...)`), annotated with `;;SETTER`.
4. **`Getters`**: Accessors (`Class_get*(...)`), annotated with `;;GETTER`.

### Required Header Structure (Single CLASS — No MODULE):
```c
#include "annotation/definition.h"
#include "annotation/overview.h"
#include "annotation/getter.h"
#include "annotation/setter.h"
#include "subsystem/class.h"
// ...

;;DEFINITION
/**
 * ============================================================================
 * DEFINITION: ClassName
 * ============================================================================
 * Paragraphical architectural definition: why this class exists, what problem it
 * solves, and why no existing class subsumes its responsibility.
 *
 * Explains memory layout, alignment, cache-line packing, lifetime, and operational
 * invariants (e.g. lockless guarantees, bounded waits, cold vs hot paths), scaling
 * naturally in length with the complexity of the subsystem.
 * ============================================================================
 */

;;OVERVIEW
/**
 * ============================================================================
 * CLASS: ClassName (inherits BaseClass -> GrandParentClass)
 * LEVEL: L2 — Behavior (Four System Levels Law: L1 metadata / L2 behavior / L3 module / L4 self-mgmt)
 * ============================================================================
 * SUMMARY:
 *   Brief high-level summary of the class and its primary responsibility.
 *
 * STRUCT FIELDS (Mirroring subsystem/class.h — exactly this file's class):
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   FieldType1 field1;       // Detailed description & alignment/units
 *   FieldType2 field2;       // Detailed description & constraints
 *
 * PRIVATE HELPERS (kept file-local pure-data only, each with full fields):
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   HelperName helper_field1;  // type + name + role per field
 *   HelperName helper_field2;
 *
 * FUNCTION REGISTRY:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Public Constructors: (.h)
 *   - ClassName()                            : ClassName_0()
 *   - ClassName(arg1)                        : ClassName_1(arg1)
 *
 * Private Constructors: (.c static)
 *   - (none)
 *
 * Public Core Functions: (.h)
 *   - ClassName_process(self, input, dest)   : Primary operational logic
 *
 * Private Core Functions: (.c static)
 *   - helperCompute(val)                     : Internal algorithm helper
 *
 * Public Setters: (.h)
 *   - ClassName_setX(self, x)
 *   - ClassName_setSize(self, w, h)
 *
 * Private Setters: (.c static)
 *   - internalSetFlags(self, flags)
 *
 * Public Getters: (.h)
 *   - ClassName_getX(const self)
 *   - ClassName_getSize(const self, outW, outH)
 *
 * Private Getters: (.c static)
 *   - (none)
 * ============================================================================
 */
```

### Source Body Organization:
The implementation body is grouped under distinct visual comment banners in strict order:
1. **`// CONSTRUCTORS (PUBLIC & PRIVATE)`**: `Class_0()`, `Class_1(...)`, and lifecycle instantiators.
2. **`// CORE FUNCTIONS (PUBLIC & PRIVATE)`**: Compute, tick, render handlers, layout algorithms, transformation logic.
3. **`// SETTERS (PUBLIC & PRIVATE)`**: All state mutators (`Class_set*(...)`), annotated with `;;SETTER`.
4. **`// GETTERS (PUBLIC & PRIVATE)`**: All field inspectors and state accessors (`Class_get*(...)`), annotated with `;;GETTER`.

### The Living Overview Law (Zero Drift):
Any modification, refactor, or addition that touches a struct's fields, constructors, or methods **must update the `;;OVERVIEW` and `;;DEFINITION` header blocks in the same commit**. An out-of-date overview or definition is a compiler/code defect.

`MODULE:` headers are banned except for true procedural entry points
(`main/*.c`, `tests/*.c`, thin re-export shims) that own zero structs.
Every class file uses `CLASS:`. A file owning two public structs must be
split before its overview is written — never document two classes under
one `MODULE:` to hide the violation. Private file-local helpers (no API)
are listed under a `PRIVATE HELPERS` section, never as a second `CLASS:`.

---

## 21. Symmetric Getter/Setter Completeness Law (Java-Library Standard)

In `darling` and high-level class abstractions, every state-bearing field on a class struct must provide complete, symmetric getters and setters, exactly like an idiomatic Java or C# library.

A consumer of the library should never have to manually pierce struct internals or violate the Two-Layer Access Cap Law just to inspect simple state:
- If a `Label` has a `char *text`, it must provide `Label_setText(lbl, text)` and `const char *Label_getText(const Label *lbl)`.
- If a `Label` has `fontSize`, it must provide `Label_setFontSize(lbl, size)` and `float Label_getFontSize(const Label *lbl)`.

### Signature Conventions:
1. **Mutators**: `void Class_set<Prop>(Class *self, <Type> val)`
2. **Scalar / Pointer Accessors**: `<Type> Class_get<Prop>(const Class *self)`
3. **Boolean Accessors**: `bool Class_is<Prop>(const Class *self)` or `bool Class_has<Prop>(const Class *self)`
4. **Multi-Value Accessors**: Follow the Dest-Last Law:
   ```c
   void Class_getSize(const Class *self, float *outW, float *outH);
   void Class_getCrop(const Picture *self, float *outX1, float *outY1, float *outX2, float *outY2);
   ```
5. **Null-Safety**: All getters must defensively check if `self` is `nullptr` and return safe defaults (`nullptr`, `0`, `false`, `0.0f`).

---

## 22. Per-Repo Commit Message Scope Law (No Repo Prefix — Scope to Class/Subsystem)

A commit lives inside exactly one repository, so the message must read as if
that repository is the whole world. Never prefix with the repo name.

```text
feat(window): add WindowCursorType and cursor selection API   // yes (in hotcwap)
feat(cursor): add Cursor class and predefined singletons      // yes (in darling)
feat(paint): add stroke, base brush, and SDF raster tips      // yes (in graphvex)
feat(mesh): add mesh buffers and 128-triangle meshlet cluster // yes (in graphvex)
test(label): add headless test suite for label and cursor     // yes (in darling)

feat(hotcwap): add WindowCursorType ...                       // no — redundant repo scope
feat(darling): add Cursor, Label, and Compositor ...          // no — unrelated multi-subsystem blob
```

The scope in parens names the *class, subsystem, or seam* within the repo
(`window`, `cursor`, `label`, `mesh`, `paint`, `sync`, `compositor`),
following the Cohesive Commits Law: **one logical feature or cohesive
subsystem per repository**. Cross-cutting changes still commit upstream-first
per the Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law, each with its own repo-local
message. Scope names the class/subsystem; the unit shipped is its file pair
(`.h+.c`).

---

## 23. Teardown Order Law (Destroy Top-Down, Free Last)

Shutdown runs the stack in reverse, and `Memory_freeAll` is always the final
step — never earlier. Shims allocate outside the slabs (`calloc`,
`IOSurfaceCreate`, `strdup`), so freeing the arena first orphans every
surface, layer, and native handle with no record of the leak.

```
Window_destroy(w)            // detach adapters, close (never release-then-use)
  → Darling_shutdownCompositor()  // per-panel surfaces + layers first
    → Vk_shutdown()               // device, surface, instance
      → Thread_stopAll() / joins  // workers joined BEFORE their resources die
        → Memory_freeAll()        // arena reset LAST, after all teardowns
```

- Detach before free (Lesson 9): registry → parent → free. `PanelCocoa_free`
  must run before its `Panel` is freed; a `Window` detaches adapters before
  `close`.
- A skipped step is a leak, not a shortcut. If a probe exits without
  `Window_destroy`, the `NSWindow` outlives the process as a ghost.
- Multi-app Kernel order (`R1` host, N apps x M windows): `Kernel_destroy`
  stops all `Console` sessions (`SIGTERM` children, non-blocking reap per
  the Bounded Wait Law), detaches all `Application`s out of graphvex's
  `GfxLoop`, retires all `Process` hot-mod pins, closes all windows,
  bounded-joins every supervised thread per the Bounded Wait Law, then
  graphvex `Vk_shutdown` (which joins the `GfxLoop` present thread inside its
  own teardown), resets `transientArena`, destroys master `arena` LAST. Never
  free `arena` while any process kind / Window still runs.

---

## 24. Bounded Wait Law (No Unbounded Waits on Joined Threads)

Any thread another thread joins must reach its exit check within a bounded
time on every path. An infinite wait (`UINT64_MAX` fence, endless queue poll)
on a worker parks `pthread_join` forever and freezes teardown — the window
goes ghost, unstopped threads keep logging, `Window_destroy` never runs.

```c
// no — hangs teardown when the drawable dies (fullscreen close)
WaitForFences_fn(dev, 1, &fence, VK_TRUE, UINT64_MAX);

// yes — drop the frame, re-check running, join succeeds in ~100ms
if (WaitForFences_fn(dev, 1, &fence, VK_TRUE, 100000000ULL) != VK_SUCCESS)
    return false;
```

- Fences, queue waits, and device idles on worker paths all take explicit
  timeouts with a drop-degrade path (skip frame, keep old content, return).
- The bound is generous (100ms ≈ 6 frames) so healthy hitches never trip it;
  only a dead resource does. A timeout firing in the log means the resource
  died — investigate the resource, not the timeout.

---

## 25. Four System Levels Law (L1–L4 — File Stability, NOT Runtime Rank R1–R5)

Every file lives on exactly one L level. Stability increases downward; replaceability increases upward. `L` answers "how safe is it to edit this file?" `R` (the Vertical Integration Law) answers "who boots/supervises whom at runtime?" Never mix them: `R1 hotcwap > R2 vexspoke > R3 graphvex/api-haven > R4 interfaces > R5 engines` is supervision; `L1–L4` below is edit-risk. A `Kernel` file is `LEVEL: L4` living at `R1` — write `LEVEL: L4`, never `LEVEL: R1`.

```
L1  FILE METADATA ............ declarative, easily replaced custom stuff —
                                the files other files consume: manifests,
                                descriptors, schemas (hot/manifest.h, JSON).
                                Swappable with zero code changes.
         │ depends on
         ▼
L2  BEHAVIOR ................. how custom structs/classes work: the class
                                API surface — constructors, core functions,
                                setters, getters (the Living `;;OVERVIEW`
                                Blueprint Law registries).
         │ depends on
         ▼
L3  MODULE CODE .............. actual .dylib behavior: business logic running
                                inside reloaded modules. Never window, OS, or
                                memory management (hot/hot_behavior.c).
         │ depends on
         ▼
L4  SELF-MANAGEMENT .......... the bottom that manages everything above:
                                hotcwap's loader (watch, verify, swap, retire),
                                the OS window, memory management. The system
                                reflecting on itself — fixing and upgrading
                                itself (hot/hot.c, hot_trampoline.c,
                                hot_retire.c, window/, nio/mem.c).
```

- A file's `;;OVERVIEW` must declare its level: `LEVEL: L1 — File Metadata`
  (and so on) directly under the `CLASS:` line, so a reader knows instantly
  how stable vs replaceable the file is.
- L-levels (file replaceability) are orthogonal to R-levels (the Vertical
  Integration Law runtime supervision R1–R5). A `Kernel` file is
  `LEVEL: L4 — Self-Management` living at `R1 Host`. Never write `LEVEL: R1`
  — levels are L, supervision is R.
- L4 files change rarely and review heavily: a bug at the bottom breaks
  every level above. L1 files change freely: a bad manifest only breaks
  one module load, caught by ABI verification before any swap.
- New files default to the highest level they can live on. Pushing logic
  downward (L2 → L4) needs justification; it makes the foundation bigger.

## 26. AI-First Architecture Manifesto Law

### Definition:
The extreme, verbose, and "masochistic" boilerplate spanning this codebase (zero arrow sugar `(*ptr).field`, strict single-class-per-file Java Law, explicit C constructor overloads, vtable dispatches, symmetric getters/setters, dest-last parameters, two-layer member dereference caps, and zero steady-state allocation) is NOT an accident, nor a misunderstanding of idiomatic C. It is an intentional, rigorous architectural manifesto of **AI-Human Pair Systems Programming**.

### The Why:
1. **Machine Comprehension & Context Density**:
   Modern LLMs and AI coding agents operate with maximum precision and zero hallucination when code contracts are explicit, typed, un-aliased, and local. Arrow sugar `->` obscures the pointer dereference boundary; implicit constructors hide initialization order; packing multiple classes into a single file pollutes the model's context window and causes cross-struct hallucinations. By restricting every file to a single class struct and its explicit methods, an AI agent can hold the complete, un-truncated operational reality of any class in its active reasoning window.
2. **Deterministic Mechanical Syntax (`(*ptr).field`)**:
   In C, `.` denotes value access and `->` denotes pointer dereference. By writing `(*ptr).field`, the dereference is visually and syntactically explicit. The developer and the AI agent are constantly reminded of memory hops, preventing casual indirection and cache-line thrashing.
3. **The AI Agent as Boilerplate Engine**:
   Human developers historically embraced macro trickery, implicit casting, and sloppy multi-class dumping to avoid typing repetitive boilerplate. In this project, **an AI coding agent writes, verifies, refactors, and maintains the dense boilerplate**. The human software architect directs high-level architectural invariants, algorithms, and concurrency semantics, while the AI agent reliably stamps out the explicit getters, setters, overviews, and constructor dispatches. The boilerplate is no longer a human typing burden—it is a machine-readable safety scaffold.

### The Sanity Warning:

> We do not accept Pull Requests, issues, or stylistic refactors attempting to re-introduce `->`, collapse multiple classes into single files, eliminate explicit getters/setters, or "modernize" the code against our architectural doctrine. The upstream codebase is exclusively maintained by its author in tandem with the AI agent.

## 27. Living Preferences Law (Zero Drift for Invariants)

### Definition:
`preferences.md` at the root of the `vexgraph` workspace is the supreme constitutional law and single source of truth for the entire multi-repo ecosystem (`hotcwap`, `darling`, `vexspoke`, `graphvex`, `api-haven`).

### The Why:
In a multi-repository workspace consisting of independently versioned C and native libraries, architectural entropy and convention drift are fatal. If rules live only in developer memory, chat histories, or scattered READMEs, rules will be contradicted and broken within days. A system with zero GC and manual memory layouts requires absolute, unbroken alignment across all subsystems.

### The Rule:
1. **Same-Cycle Update & Local Commit**:
   Whenever an architectural invariant, convention, rule, or preference is introduced, modified, refined, or clarified, `preferences.md` must be updated and locally committed in the same development cycle. Out-of-date preferences are an architectural defect.
2. **Universal Reference Link**:
   Every sub-repository must include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that explicitly links back to `vexgraph/preferences.md` as its supreme guiding authority.
3. **Subsystem Conformance**:
   Every implementation across `hotcwap`, `darling`, `vexspoke`, `graphvex`, and `api-haven` must adhere strictly to the laws codified herein. No repository is exempt.
4. **Title-Identity Enforcement**:
   Because this document is living, no law may be cited by its number anywhere — in code, in docs, or in git history — only by its canonical Title per the Law Identity Doctrine. Any stale numeric citation is a defect to fix in the same cycle it is noticed.

## 28. Conflict Triage Law — Managed Exception, Not Veto

### Definition:
When laws conflict, or intent outgrows a law, the answer is never a bare "this violates X." It is "unless you want it, here is how we manage it." The thought prevails; the laws adapt in the same cycle per the Living Preferences Law.

### The Why:
A veto-only system freezes ambition (multi-app Kernel, R1–R5 ecosystem, 30 grammars, game engines). Tier 1 exists to prevent crashes, not to prevent thinking. Every conflict is triaged, given a managed path, and codified so the next agent inherits the decision.

### The Protocol:
1. **Name the tiers:** Tier 1 (crash/leak/deadlock/memory/thread safety) beats Tier 2 (model/contracts) beats Tier 3 (syntax). State which tier each conflicting law lives on.
2. **Assess before blocking:** state applicability first — does the law actually cover this case (link-time vs runtime, single-app vs Kernel multi-app, global vs per-arena)? A misapplied law is not a violation.
3. **Managed exception:** propose the indirection that preserves Tier 1 while granting intent. Canonical moves: opaque handle + callbacks instead of downstream `#include` (keeps the Vertical Integration Law / Standalone Autonomy Law); fixed array + count + getter instead of `**` chains (keeps the Two-Layer Access Cap Law); `MemoryArena_create/freeAll` + bounded-join instead of globals (keeps the Teardown Order Law / Bounded Wait Law); `;;INTENTION("reason")` + `;;DRAFT` markers for Tier 2/3 waivers.
4. **Prefs patch in-cycle:** if intent prevails, draft the exact `preferences.md` wording change now. Tier 1 waivers additionally require an alternate safety proof (no unbounded wait, no use-after-free, no circular link) reviewed heavily. Tier 2/3 waivers require `;;INTENTION` + overview/docs update in the same commit.
5. **Never silent drift:** a managed exception without its prefs + overview + docs update is a defect, same as stale prefs under the Living Preferences Law.

## 29. Cold-Strict, Hot-Minimal Validation Law (Crash-Guard Split)

### Definition:
Validation splits by path temperature. The Tier-1 crash-guard half: no function
ever crashes, blocks unboundedly, allocates, or use-after-frees on null,
out-of-bounds, overflow, cancelled, or timed-out input — it returns `false` or
a Symmetric Getter/Setter Completeness Law safe default instead. The Tier-2
contract half: setters validate at least as strictly as getters, with the
reject-or-clamp policy stated in the `;;OVERVIEW`; getters return safe
defaults per the Symmetric Getter/Setter Completeness Law.

### The Why:
Unvalidated cold input (network bytes, JSON, spawned output, checksums) is how
null dereferences and overflows enter the system; re-validating every element
on a 60fps hot path is how frames die. Validate once where input enters, trust
the validated handle where pixels move. A silent truncation or an unlogged
cold drop corrupts state; a log line per hot frame corrupts performance.

### The Rule:
1. **Cold paths validate exhaustively, once.** R1-entry / R2-boundary seams
   (`AiProvider_get`, `ApiAuth_apply`, `Rest_postJson`,
   `McpServer_handleLine`, `HavenWsFanout_pollStep`, `ProcessSpawn_spawn`,
   checksums) check every hostile input: null, empty, wrong-id, bounds,
   integer overflow, cancelled, timeout. One `Log_warn` per failure at most,
   then drop-degrade per the Bounded Wait Law (return `false`, keep old
   content, move on).
2. **Hot paths guard minimally, never log.** Vk present, `Raster`, `SdfGpu`,
   darling layout, `GfxLoop_frame`, `presentFrameLocked`: at most one `nullptr`
   entry guard returning `false`, zero per-element revalidation, zero logging,
   zero allocation. The hot path trusts the cold-validated handle. Deeper
   invariants are proven at compile time (`_Static_assert`) or declared as
   `;;INTENTION("reason")` + `;;DRAFT` per the Conflict Triage Law, never
   re-checked per frame.
   ```c
   if (self == nullptr)
       return false;
   ```
3. **The Truncation-Never-Silent clause.** Copying into a bounded buffer takes
   `(src, dest, destCap, outTruncated)` — dest-last per the Dest-Last Law,
   flag last. On cut: return `false` and set the flag so the caller degrades
   loudly.
   ```c
   bool Class_copyText(const char *src, char *dest, size_t destCap, bool *outTruncated);
   ```
4. **Seam tests at cold boundaries only.** The full
   nullptr / empty / wrong-id / overflow / truncation / cancelled / timeout
   matrix lives at public cold seams in `tests/*.c` `MODULE` harnesses. Hot
   paths carry `nullptr`-guard-only tests — no per-element matrix, no timing
   harness on the frame path.

## 30. Data-Oriented Storage Law & Object-Oriented Ergonomics

### Definition:
Collection patterns (nodes, lists, tables, trees) use data-oriented storage — flat
arrays, index-based relationships, zero pointer chasing — with object-oriented
ergonomic API: class methods, part verbs (the Sub-Part Field Segregation Law),
symmetric getters/setters (the Symmetric Getter/Setter Completeness Law),
dest-last parameters (the Dest-Last Law). This is the default for any
collection of records.

### The Why:
Index-based flat arrays keep CPU cache lines hot and make bulk traversal
mechanically simple; object-oriented ergonomics (methods, getters/setters,
dest-last) make the resulting API feel familiar to anyone trained in Java or C#,
without sacrificing hardware-level performance. The two are not in tension —
they are complementary halves of a modern C23 collection design.

### The Rule:
1. **Storage is flat and index-based.** Parent/child relationships are encoded
   as integer indices into a flat array, never as pointer-chased linked lists.
   Pre-order array layout is the canonical form for trees: a node's entire
   subtree occupies a contiguous range `[nodeIndex, nodeIndex + subtreeSize)`,
   so bulk traversal never jumps.
2. **API is object-oriented.** Every collection is a class (the Single Class
   Per File Law) with constructors, part verbs (the Sub-Part Field Segregation
   Law), symmetric getters/setters (the Symmetric Getter/Setter Completeness
   Law), and dest-last output parameters (the Dest-Last Law). Consumers never
   pierce internals.
3. **`ExpandableListContainer` + `ExpandableNode` is the canonical instance**
   for hierarchical/nested lists: file trees, task checklists, outlines, mind
   maps, schema viewers. `ExpandableNode` is a behaviourless slot record
   (the Single Class Per File Law SLOT RECORD) owned by
   `ExpandableListContainer`.
4. **Checklists are not a separate class.** A checklist is an
   `ExpandableListContainer` instance with `checklistMode` enabled — never a
   distinct `Checklist` or `TaskList` type. The checkbox lives at child slot 1
   within the row panel, toggled via `setChecked`/`isChecked`.
5. **FileList is composition, not a separate class.** A file tree viewer
   composes `ExpandableListContainer` with R2 `File`/`VFS` data — never a
   standalone `FileList` class. The data is R2; the widget is R4 darling.

---

## 31. Living Feature Readiness Law (Zero Drift for Status)

### Definition:
Each repository's feature readiness matrix lives in the ecosystem wiki repo (`../../_repositories/.ecosystem/<repo>.md`, rendered as the `[[<repo>]]` wiki pages), one row per feature (container/widget/module/command), each carrying a scope line and a status emoji. The matrix is a **living inventory**, not a snapshot: its status column is the machine-readable handshake the ecosystem uses to know what is real vs stubbed vs absent.

### The Why:
Multi-repo ecosystems rot silently — a header-only dialog or a half-stubbed picker looks "implemented" from the call site until someone depends on it and hits the empty paint. A single, always-current matrix — one row per unit, read by machines and humans alike — makes build-readiness legible at a glance, keeps scope lines honest, and exposes the next structural wedge (the largest contiguous 🟥 block) the moment it appears.

### The Rule:
1. **Same-cycle status law, per file pair.** Any commit that ships, stubs, retires, or re-scopes a feature **must move its `../../_repositories/.ecosystem/<repo>.md` row in the same cycle** — code commit first, wiki row-write immediately after, never a deferred "update checklist" blob (the Cohesive Commits Law / Commit and Push Discipline Law). Code and wiki live in different repos so they ship as separate per-repo commits, but a green-on-disk row that is stale-red on the sheet is still a broken intermediate state.
2. **Status legend (canonical, mirrors the wiki `Home.md` Status Legend):** 💚 98% done, production-ready · 🟩 95% done, implemented & functional · 🟨 85% done, substantially implemented · 🟧 75% done, partial/draft · 🟥 concept/draft, zero working source · ⬜ vital future work, not implemented (⬜ is never "dropped/archived"; it marks an important concept not yet built). A row's scope line is rewritten when the actor or deliverable changes, not just the emoji.
3. **Test proof gates the status.** 🟨 rows carry test names in the scope column (`tests/<name>_test`); a row is never 🟩 before its unit tests pass under `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` (the Cohesive Commits Law). Moving a row up without its proof is inflation; use the Conflict Triage Law (`;;INTENTION`) instead of silently overstating.
4. **Commits are per-checklist-file, per-repo.** The matrix lives as one row-write inside its feature commit; cross-repo rows never bundle (the Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law). Code and wiki ship as separate per-repo commits in the same cycle — the code commit carries the behavior, the wiki commit carries the row.
5. **The spearhead is the wedge, not the tail.** The next work item is chosen as the structural keystone that unblocks the largest contiguous block of 🟥 rows (e.g. `OverlayRoot` unblocking the dialog/dropdown family), then the block collapses down the matrix — mirrors the upstream-first law (the Multi-Repo Atomic Commit Discipline Law).

---

## 32. Test Segregation Law (Zero Source Pollution — No Tests in Source Trees)

### Definition:
Test code and harnesses NEVER reside inside production source directories (`src/`, `darling/`, `render/`, `main/`, `app/`, etc.). All unit tests, integration tests, benchmark harnesses, and test fixtures across the ecosystem live in dedicated test trees partitioned by subsystem under `_tests/<subsystem>/`. Production source trees contain only production classes, headers, and build scripts.

### The Why:
Colocating tests alongside production source files pollutes the clean 1:1 class-to-file architecture (the Single Class Per File Law), confuses directory-based build tools and file watchers, muddles static analysis, degrades search/grep ergonomics, and creates risks of circular dependencies or accidental linkage of test helpers into production shared libraries. A source directory must be purely production code; test suites are clients of the subsystems they test and must sit in segregated test directories.

### The Rule:
1. **Zero test files in production trees.** No file named `*_test.c`, `test_*.c`, `*_test.h`, `test_*.h`, or `*_demo.c` may ever be placed in or committed to a production source directory (`src/`, `darling/`, `render/`, `text/`, `event/`, `app/`, `hot/`, etc.). Violations must be rejected in review and failed in CI.
2. **Unified test hierarchy.** All test sources reside under `_tests/<subsystem>/` (e.g., `_tests/darling/`, `_tests/vexspoke/`, `_tests/graphvex/`, `_tests/hotcwap/`, `_tests/api-haven/`).
3. **Subsystem partitioning.** Tests are grouped strictly by the subsystem they exercise:
   - `_tests/darling/`: UI widgets, containers, text rendering, layout, and event dispatcher tests.
   - `_tests/vexspoke/`: Core primitive, memory, threading, time, io, and relational tests.
   - `_tests/graphvex/`: GPU buffers, rendering passes, texture, and font backend tests.
   - `_tests/hotcwap/`: Hot reload, manifest parser, kernel, and window lifecycle tests.
   - `_tests/api-haven/`: API client, webhooks, MCP server, SSE, and AI provider tests.
4. **Standalone repo test contract.** If a project is checked out standalone without the umbrella `_tests/` root, it must keep its tests segregated in a top-level `tests/` directory at the repo root (e.g. `../<repo>/tests/`), never inside `src/` or component folders. In umbrella builds, `_tests/` is the canonical locus.
5. **No test artifact commits.** Build artifacts, test scratch dumps, and test binaries must be excluded by `.gitignore` (`_tests/` or build output directories).

---

## 33. Dynamic Scalability & Anti-Hardcoding Law (No Artificial Limits)

### Definition:
No algorithm, container, layout engine, or rendering pass may ever hardcode fixed task counts, capacity ceilings, or artificial element limits (e.g. `for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)`, fixed array sizes for dynamic entities, or assumptions like "there are only 2 panels"). Systems must be engineered to handle whatever volume, resolution, or throughput is thrown at them — scaling seamlessly from 0 to $N$.

### The Why:
Hardcoded iteration limits and static capacity assumptions turn code into throwaway prototypes. When an engine assumes a fixed count or bakes dimensions (like hardcoded `640x400` or fixed 4 corners), any real-world workload breaks it. True systems architecture is scale-invariant: the same code that handles 1 child must handle 10,000 children with zero structural rewrites.

### The Rule:
1. **No Hardcoded Loops for Dynamic Work:**
   Writing loops bounded by magic constants (`i < 4`, `i < 2`) to perform structural tasks is a defect. Iteration must be driven by dynamic child counts, queryable collections, or data-driven descriptor streams.
2. **No Capacity Ceilings:**
   Containers, layer registries, viewports, and pass managers must not impose arbitrary hard limits that reject or ignore elements beyond a static constant. Where fixed memory pools are required for zero steady-state allocation (the Data-Oriented Storage Law), storage must grow exponentially or re-index dynamically.
3. **No "Cheat" Modes or Motion Gates:**
   Gating or crippling functionality behind flags like `isLiveResizing` or "only at rest" to avoid implementing the general real-time case is forbidden. If a system can do it at idle, it must be engineered to do it under continuous motion and resize stress.
4. **Generalized Geometry & Anchor Math:**
   All positioning, anchoring, and layout math must be computed dynamically from parent extents $(W, H)$ via relative ratios or anchor matrices, never baked to static pixel constants.

---

---

## 34. No Section Sign Law

### Definition:
The section sign (U+00A7) — the "double-S" — is forbidden everywhere: source comments, `;;OVERVIEW` blocks, docs, commit messages, wiki rows, and this document. Section references are always written as plain ASCII words: "see section 32", "the KeyMap section", "sections 41–48" — never the glyph-prefixed forms.

### The Why:
The glyph renders as an ugly double-S that reads as a typo in monospace, breaks `grep` for section references, and mangles in fonts, terminal pipelines, and localized tooling. The word "section" costs nothing and survives every tool, font, and copy-paste intact. A codebase that already bans arrow sugar for machine-readability has no business smuggling invisible punctuation into comments.

### The Rule:
1. **Never write the glyph.** New code, new docs, new commits: the character (U+00A7) is a defect on arrival, same as `->` under the No Arrow Sugar Law. Write "section" (or drop the marker) instead.
2. **Migration completed workspace-wide.** Every occurrence in the workspace was scrubbed in the same cycle as this update — source comments, test-section markers, `_docs/` and `_bugs/` notes, and this document. A reintroduced glyph is a defect on arrival (the Living Preferences Law zero-drift rule applies to this migration too).
3. **Canonical artifacts.** The occurrences present in `preferences.md` and the canonical docs at the time this law landed were scrubbed with it; the umbrella-local legacy markers now read as plain words (`// section N` test-section comments).

---

---

## 35. Per-Repo Preferences Extension Law

### Definition:
The central `preferences.md` codified in `vexspoke` serves exclusively as the universal supreme constitution, containing only the foundational invariants mandatory across all ecosystems and repositories. Individual repositories maintain their own standalone, self-identifying `<repo>-preferences.md` file at their repository root. Each per-repo preferences file carries the universal constitution plus any domain-specific laws that physically bind that repository's system level and responsibilities.

### The Why:
Monolithic constitutions force developers and AI agents working on isolated subsystems (e.g. GPU shaders, database persistence, or audio processing) to parse through dozens of irrelevant UI or windowing rules with no clear signal of which laws actually bind their work. Conversely, fragmenting rules without a central authority causes silent divergence and rule drift. Decoupling repo-local mirrors from the universal constitution ensures immediate clarity of local obligations while preserving universal invariants with zero drift.

### The Rule:
1. **Naming:** Every repository-local preferences file must be named `<repo>-preferences.md` (e.g., `graphvex-preferences.md`, `hotcwap-preferences.md`) located at the repository root. It never shadows or renames the universal `preferences.md`.
2. **Standalone Autonomy:** Each file sits physically at its own repository root and is never a symlink into `vexspoke`. Repositories checked out standalone remain fully self-describing.
3. **Restatement Policy:** Each `<repo>-preferences.md` carries the full canonical prose of every law that binds it (the universal core plus applicable domain-specific laws). Restated section headers use canonical Titles only (`### <Law Title>`) without numeric ordinals.
4. **;;SYNC Provenance Header:** Every per-repo mirror must declare its synchronization provenance header at the top of the document:
   `;;SYNC("mirrors ecosystem/vexspoke/preferences.md @ 2026.09-universal")`
   referencing the canonical edition of the universal constitution.
5. **Zero Drift Same-Cycle Regeneration:** Whenever the universal `preferences.md` is updated, all affected per-repo mirror files must be regenerated and committed in the same development cycle.
6. **Law Binding Matrix:** Each per-repo preferences file maintains an explicit Law Binding Matrix table categorizing all binding laws by their architectural tiers.

---

## 36. Arity and Constructive Convenience Law

### Definition:
Every class across the ecosystem ships a **uniform, arity-based convenience surface**, so an object is instantiated, extended, zeroed, and named with canonical constants — never with ad-hoc literals or per-class bespoke spellings. It binds **every framework**, because every part speaks arity.

1. **Arity constructors — every single time.** Every public class provides `Class_0()`, `Class_1(a)`, `Class_2(a, b)`, … (the Vec4 chooser idiom) plus a `Class(...)` dispatch macro that selects by argument count. Construction is always `Class(...)` — never a bespoke `make_*` / `new_*` / `create_*`.
2. **`Class_add(...)`.** Every additive or collection class provides `Class_add(...)` — the class's natural additive/append verb (list add, vector add, set union, string append, …).
3. **`Class_zero()`.** Every class provides `Class_zero()` (or a `ZERO` constant) — the additive identity / empty element.
4. **Canonical named constants.** Numeric magnitudes and extremes are named once, canonically: `ZERO`, `ONE`, `ONE_MILLION`, `ONE_BILLION`, `ONE_TRILLION`, `FLOAT_POS_INF`, `FLOAT_NEG_INF`, `DOUBLE_POS_INF`, `DOUBLE_NEG_INF`, `INT_MAX_VALUE`, `INT_MIN_VALUE`, `TYPE_MAX_VALUE`, `TYPE_MIN_VALUE`, and many more — so a call site writes `-ONE` and reads -1, never a bare `-1` literal.

### The Why:
**Tesler's Law (the Law of Conservation of Complexity):** *"Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction."* — Larry Tesler.

The complexity of *"how do I instantiate this / extend it / zero it / name its extremes"* cannot be deleted — it has to live somewhere. This law pays that complexity **once**, in the library (product development), and hands every developer a uniform, arity-based, constructive surface (the user-interaction side) — so a call site never invents a spelling, and the convenience sits with the developer because the library already absorbed the cost. It is a **universal** law: every framework ships the same arity surface, so the whole ecosystem reads as one language.

### The Rule:
1. **Every public class ships `Class_0()`, `Class_1()`, … and the `Class(...)` arity chooser.** No class is constructible only through a bespoke factory name.
2. **Every additive/collection class ships `Class_add(...)`.**
3. **Every class ships `Class_zero()` (or `ZERO`).**
4. **Canonical numeric constants live in one header.** No bare `-1`, `1000000`, or `INFINITY` literals at a call site — the name is the contract.
5. **Uniform across repos.** Same names, same shapes everywhere — the convenience surface is identical in every framework (the Per-Repo Preferences Extension Law restates it, never forks it).

---

## 37. toString Law (Every Object Has a String)

### Definition:
Every class across the ecosystem ships **two bounded string projections**:

1. **`Class_toString(self, dest, cap, outTruncated)`** — the **VALUE** string: a concise, class-specific summary of the object's state.
2. **`Class_toStringStruct(self, dest, cap, outTruncated)`** — the **STRUCTURE** string: a by-name dump of the object's own fields (**ONE layer only** — a nested object field renders via that object's `toString`, never by recursing into its `toStringStruct`).

Both are bounded (dest-last + a truncation flag) and cold-path only.

### The Why:
Every object has a string, and without a uniform contract each subsystem invents its own ad-hoc printing — un-greppable, un-cappable, and unusable by an agent. One uniform pair makes state legible everywhere (a debugger's `po`, a log line, an agent's context). And the struct dump **mirrors the `;;OVERVIEW` STRUCT FIELDS** block, so the two enforce each other: a field added without updating the dump is a defect, exactly like a stale overview.

### The Rule:
1. **Every public class ships both.** No class is string-blind.
2. **Fixed signature:** `(const Class *self, char *dest, size_t cap, bool *outTruncated)` — dest-last (the Dest-Last Law), bounded, truncation flagged (the Cold-Strict, Hot-Minimal Validation Law).
3. **Null-safe:** a null `self` writes `"nullptr"`, never crashes.
4. **Cold-path only:** never called on a frame — it formats.
5. **`toStringStruct` mirrors the `;;OVERVIEW` STRUCT FIELDS** — same fields, same declaration order.
6. **ONE LAYER, no recursion.** A struct dump prints only this class's fields; a nested object field renders via its `toString`. Depth is bounded by design (no recursion guard needed); a class that wants a deeper view calls the child's `toStringStruct` itself.
7. **Escape:** string fields are emitted quoted and escaped (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`).
8. **Buffer only:** the bounded form is the law; there is no heap `toStringAlloc`.
9. **The formatter fuses here:** the Label formatter's `{object}` placeholder calls `toString`.

---

## 38. Authorial Intent Law

### Definition:
Deliberate author decisions — magic sentinels, sugar macros, naming choices that look surprising on first read (`SIZE_AUTO` as the FourCC `åuto`, `VEX_*` sugar, and their kin) — are documented at their definition site as intentional acts of the author, vex. The stamp is a plain comment, never a `;;` annotation macro:

```c
// INTENTIONAL(vex): SIZE_AUTO is the FourCC "åuto" (0xE575746F) by design —
// negative on every platform so any negative dimension reads as AUTO.
```

`;;INTENTION("reason")` keeps its existing meaning under the Conflict Triage Law: why a waiver or managed exception exists. `// INTENTIONAL(vex): ...` means something narrower: this strangeness is not a bug, not AI drift, not a placeholder — the author chose it and wants it preserved.

### The Why:
An AI pair-programmer writes most of the boilerplate in this ecosystem, so a future reader (human or agent) cannot tell a deliberate aesthetic from an accident. Without a provenance stamp, the next passer-by "fixes" the magic: normalizes the FourCC to a round number, renames the sugar to something bland, refactors away the joke that was actually a contract. The stamp draws a line around the author's deliberate weirdness and says: this survived review, it is load-bearing taste, leave it alone unless vex says otherwise.

### The Rule:
1. **Plain comment, fixed shape.** The stamp is exactly `// INTENTIONAL(vex):` followed by prose. No `;;AUTHOR`, no `;;DELIBERATE`, no new header in `src/annotation/` — the Two-Semicolon Annotation Style Law is untouched. The shape is greppable: `INTENTIONAL(vex):`.
2. **Definition site, not call sites.** One stamp where the decision is defined (the macro, the sentinel, the canonical name). Call sites stay clean — they just use it.
3. **What + why, one breath.** Each stamp states what the decision is and why it is that way (platform behavior, readability, contract). A stamp with no reason is a defect — restate or remove.
4. **Not a waiver.** Authorial intent never overrides Tier 1. A deliberate decision that risks a crash, leak, deadlock, or unbounded wait still goes through the Conflict Triage Law with its `;;INTENTION` + safety proof. `INTENTIONAL` documents taste; `INTENTION` justifies exceptions.
5. **Retrofit as noticed.** Existing deliberate decisions (`SIZE_AUTO`, `VEX_*` sugar) gain their stamps when touched or noticed, same cycle — no separate migration blob. New deliberate decisions ship their stamp in the same commit as the decision itself, per the Living Preferences Law.
