// vulkan/vk_scene.h — per-scene offscreen canvases (the scene's own buffer).
//
// A scene child owns a FIXED-size offscreen image — its private canvas. The
// scene pipeline renders into that canvas with a full-canvas viewport, so
// scene geometry never remaps against window size. The collage then stamps
// the canvas onto the monitor cache as a 1:1 blit CUT: shrinking the window
// crops the scene, it can never squish.
//
// Canvases are keyed by caller-chosen keys (a scene panel's pointer identity
// works) and created/resized lazily on first acquire. Size drift recreates.
//
// ISOLATION CONTRACT: Vulkan calls only — no window.h, no darling. Callers
// speak keys, pixel extents, command buffers.
//
// CADENCE NOTE (phase roadmap): today the canvas records inside the collage's
// present submission. Flip-buffers and an independent scene clock land later;
// this module's API is deliberately shaped so neither changes callers.

// generation-retired and dies at the next completed batch harvest, the
